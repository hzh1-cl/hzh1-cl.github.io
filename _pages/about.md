I am Zhou(周) He(贺), Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Linguistics, Indiana University. My major is Computational Linguistics and minor in Informatics. My research interests include Treebanking, Dependency Parsing, Universal Dependencies, Cross-lingual Dependency Parsing, Language Typology, Chinese Linguistics, Chinese Natural Language Inference. 

Before joining IU, I earned my M.A. in Linguistics and Applied Linguistics with a concentration in Chinese Information Processing from Beijing Normal University, and my B.A. in Chinese Linguistics from Ludong University. 

Now I am working on my Ph.D. dissertation, in which I create a dependency treebank for Xibe (ISO 639: sjo, 锡伯语, ᠰᡞᠪᡝ ᡤᡞᠰᡠᠨ) under Universal Dependencies framework, and try to find solutions to parse it. At the same time, I work as a Graduate Assistant in the departmental lab. 

I come from [Heze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heze), which is a small city with more than 8 million inhabitants in western Shandong province of China. Heze is hometown to the peony flowers and also famous for martial arts, local opera, and traditional painting and calligraphy. 


Besides everything related with languages and linguistics, I have been an amateur accordionist with more than 20 years experience.
