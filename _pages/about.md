I am He Zhou (周贺), Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Linguistics, Indiana University Bloomington. My major is Computational Linguistics and minor in Informatics. My research interests include Treebanking, Dependency Parsing, Universal Dependencies, Multilingual Dependency Parsing, Chinese Linguistics, Altaic Linguistics. 

Before joining IU, I earned my M.A. in Linguistics and Applied Linguistics with a concentration in Chinese Information Processing from Beijing Normal University, and my B.A. in Chinese Linguistics from Ludong University. 

Now I am working on my Ph.D. dissertation, in which I create a dependency treebank for Xibe (ISO 639: sjo, 锡伯语, ᠰᡞᠪᡝ ᡤᡞᠰᡠᠨ) under Universal Dependencies framework, and try to find solutions to parse it. At the same time, I work as a Graduate Assistant in the departmental lab. 

Besides everything related with languages and linguistics, I have been an amateur accordionist since 8 years old.
