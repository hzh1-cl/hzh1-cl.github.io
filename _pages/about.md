I am now working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, _Hong Kong Polytechnic University_. Before joining PolyU, I received my PhD degree in Computational Linguistics from _Indiana University_. My research interests include Language Resource Development, Morphological and Syntactic Analysis for Low-Resource Languages (with a special interest in minority languages in China). I also have research experiences in Natural Language Inference and using ML/DL techniques to differentiate similar languages. Now I am working on Interpreting Chinese Noun Compounds. 

I earned my MA in Linguistics and Applied Linguistics with a concentration in Chinese Information Processing from _Beijing Normal University_, and BA in Chinese Linguistics from _Ludong University_. 

Meanwhile, I am looking for a permanant teaching position.
