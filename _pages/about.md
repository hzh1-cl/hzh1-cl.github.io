- I am now working as a _Postdoctoral Research Fellow_ at the Department of Language Science and Technology (LST), _The Hong Kong Polytechnic University_. 

- Before joining PolyU, I received my PhD degree in Computational Linguistics from _Indiana University_. 

- My research interests include:
  - Interpretability of Language Models on Chinese Lexical Semantics and Syntax
  - Corpus-based Studies: Language Resource Creation and Annotation
  - Fundamental computational linguistics tasks: Morphological and Syntactic Analysis (with a special interest in Chinese minority languages)
  - Digital Humanities: Implementing computational linguistic techniques in humanities

- Hobbies besides research:
  - Accordion (I am familiar with piano accordion, but very eager to play bayan☺️)
  - Citywalk
  - Workout
  - Languages
  - _maybe more ..._
